# Linux Gear
Why _gear_? Well, it sounded better than _Linux Stuff_.

## What is this?
It's a repository of things I use on my own Linux machines. Home machines, work machines... yada, yada.  
Each folder will hold things like themes, aliases, images, helpful scripts, and whatever else I feel like putting in here.

If you're not me I don't know how much use you'll get from anything here, but it's here for you to look at. Enjoy.

# Directory Structure
### themes
Scripts to setup various themes. Customized for me.

### images
Various images I like to use. Most likely referenced by themes and other desktop tweaks.
