# Linux Gear
Why _gear_? Well, it sounded better than _Linux stuff_.

## What is this?
It's a repository of things I use on my own Linux machines. Home machines, work machines... You get the idea.  
Each folder will hold certain types of things like themes, aliases, images, helpful scripts, and things like that.  
If I'm feeling up to it I'll add README files to various subdirectories that will guide use. If you're not me I don't know how much use you'll get from anything here; but it'll be public so you're welcome to use whatever you like. :)

## Structure
### themes
Scripts to setup various themes. Customized for me.

### images
Various images I like to use. Most likely to be referenced by themes and other desktop tweaks.
